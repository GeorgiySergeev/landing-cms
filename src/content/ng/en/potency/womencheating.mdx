# 97% of wives after 40 consider cheating to be justified if her husband has problems with potency or if he is unable to have quality sex

This was the conclusion of an anonymous survey of Nigerian women whose husbands had problems with potency, early ejaculation or small penis size. The conclusion is fully consistent with statements made earlier by sexologists - "sexual impotence in men and the inability to bring a woman to orgasm almost always pushes women to cheating and is the most frequent cause of divorce".

Although a woman has never cheated on a man or even thought about it, the lack of satisfaction from sex "turns everything inside her head" and makes cheating not only possible, but desirable. This happens at the level of physiological processes.

**Maryam Nwokocha**, a well-known sexologist, female physician, Ph.D.:

> "Women's cheating is legitimate if there is no meaningful sex in the relationship or if the woman does not get what she needs out of it. Imagine yourself in the role of that woman. The need to have sex is created physiologically - the desire is always there, and you can't fight it off. A woman has to live with it all the time without getting the release.
>
> How does this affect a woman? Without discharge nerves are constantly tense - as a result, even a calm woman before becomes nervous and irritable. In a relationship there are scandals that can happen for no reason at all. The more the couple fights, the more the distance from each other, the relationship becomes more cold. As a result, even those women who used to be proud of their honesty towards her husband begin to cheat.
>
> Initially it happens accidentally - at work or with other people. After the first time a woman is tormented by thoughts of cheating, but she constantly recalls the feelings she got. She cannot get used to the idea that for the rest of her life she will not have sex anymore. So one day she cheats again. And then again and again. She gets a lover.
>
> However, "discharge on the side" rarely ever leads to the normalization of relations with her husband, more often than not continuous cheating further alienates the spouses, and everything ends in divorce."

**Q:** Maryam, who do you believe is to blame for this situation?

**A:** The situation is very complicated and contradictory. But you have to understand that it's not the woman's fault either.

I would advise all men - not to lead to this situation and fight the first manifestations of sexual impotence and eliminate any problems in sex. For example, the same premature ejaculation, which often affects young men. Especially since medics are now well aware of the causes of these problems, and they have learned how to effectively deal with them.

**Q:** Is it possible to increase potency and improve the quality of sex without serious interventions in your body?

We asked this question to Professor Joseph Hudu, an honored doctor of Nigeria, the head of the National Center of Urology.

> Yes, you can. Now with the advent of modern preparations this is no longer a problem. For example, I recommend to my patients a very good product called **[PRODUCT_NAME]**. It helps 99.9% of men - even those who haven't had any potency for several years and who have other sexual problems.
>
> This product has two powerful effects. First, it gives a strong surge of testosterone, which dramatically increases arousal. In simple terms, **[PRODUCT_NAME]** makes a man a male who wants sex very much. Secondly, **[PRODUCT_NAME]** increases erection by more than 30 times in just 5 minutes after intake. The effect of **[PRODUCT_NAME]** lasts for over 8 hours, which makes it possible to have sex all night long.

**Q:** Is [PRODUCT_NAME] better than Viagra?

> It is more up-to-date. Viagra is a good product, but it is very outdated. Viagra was discovered 30 years ago. It has several significant disadvantages. First, the sildenafil in its composition acts only in the presence of arousal. That is, without arousal an erection will not appear, so VIAGRA DOES NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE!
>
> The second important disadvantage of Viagra is that it causes catastrophic harm to your body. Doctors compare one dose of Viagra to shortening your life by 2 days, which is quite significant. Viagra causes serious damage to the blood vessels, heart, liver, brain, nervous system and much more.
>
> **[PRODUCT_NAME]** is the most modern product and it is devoid of these disadvantages. It increases an erection and gives arousal to absolutely everyone. For example, if a man wants to sleep so much and he takes **[PRODUCT_NAME]**, as a result - he will fall asleep, but with a strong erection and most likely while he sleeps he will have erotic dreams because he will want sex.

<u>
  That means that [PRODUCT_NAME] is a product of absolute action. If you take it, an erection and the strongest arousal
  will be guaranteed!
</u>

In addition to increasing potency **[PRODUCT_NAME]** has a number of other remarkable actions (**[PRODUCT_NAME]** - a complex product for eliminating any problems in the sexual sphere in men).

The main actions of **[PRODUCT_NAME]** also include:

- Increase in penis size (+ 30% in volume)
- Increase in interest in women and sex in general
- Increase in the pleasure you get during sex
- Increase in testosterone production (3-4 times before sex, which increases passion)
- Improve the quality and quantity of semen
- Increase in the duration of intercourse (up to 3 hours with active movement)
- Increase in sensitivity of the penis and erogenous zones

Viagra is not recommended for elderly people, people with heart disease and hypertension. **[PRODUCT_NAME]** is safe for everyone.

Due to this wide range of effects **[PRODUCT_NAME]** can be used both by men who are dissatisfied with the duration of intercourse or the size of their penis, as well as by men who have serious difficulties in achieving a stable erection or have no potency at all.

**Q:** How important is it for a man to have a stable potency? What effect does it have on health?

> Sex is important for every man. During sex, the blood vessels are cleared and the prostate secretion is renewed. When there is no sex there is stagnation in the prostate that may lead to adenoma and prostate cancer (occurs in 68% of men at the age of 50-60 years, the most common reason for the disease is sexual impotence).
>
> Moreover, blood stagnates in the vessels, especially in the small capillaries that feed all internal organs. In blood vessels due to this appears blood clots, which is fraught with high blood pressure and hypertension, and if the clot breaks off, then a heart attack or stroke.
>
> Having sex is important for men - it's the basis of health and a long trouble-free life! No less important is that good sex provides harmony in the family. Sex is essential for strong family relationships, without sex everything falls apart at once.

**Q:** Where can I order [PRODUCT_NAME] to restore potency and eliminate sexual problems, and how much does it cost?

> You can order it at the minimum price by leaving a request in a special form. In Nigeria, the drug is distributed by the National Center for Male Health, a respected organization.
>
> [PRODUCT_NAME] is delivered anywhere in the country by courier service. The delivery is completely anonymous, even the courier will not know what is in the parcel. There are no problems with buying [PRODUCT_NAME]. Everything is simple, affordable and fast.
