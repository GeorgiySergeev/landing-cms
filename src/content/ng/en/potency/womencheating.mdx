This was the conclusion of an anonymous survey of Nigerian women whose husbands had problems with potency, early ejaculation or small penis size. The conclusion is fully consistent with statements made earlier by sexologists - "sexual impotence in men and the inability to bring a woman to orgasm almost always pushes women to cheating and is the most frequent cause of divorce."

Although a woman has never cheated on a man or even thought about it, the lack of satisfaction from sex "turns everything inside her head" and makes cheating not only possible, but desirable. This happens at the level of physiological processes.

Says Maryam Nwokocha, a well-known sexologist, female physician, Ph.D.

"Women's cheating is legitimate if there is no meaningful sex in the relationship or if the woman does not get what she needs out of it. Imagine yourself in the role of that woman. The need to have sex is created physiologically - the desire is always there, and you can't fight it off. A woman has to live with it all the time without getting the release.

How does this affect a woman? Without discharge nerves are constantly tense - as a result, even a calm woman before becomes nervous and irritable. In a relationship there are scandals that can happen for no reason at all. The more the couple fights, the more the distance from each other, the relationship becomes more cold. As a result, even those women who used to be proud of their honesty towards her husband begin to cheat.

Initially it happens accidentally - at work or with other people. After the first time a woman is tormented by thoughts of cheating, but she constantly recalls the feelings she got. She cannot get used to the idea that for the rest of her life she will not have sex anymore. So one day she cheats again. And then again and again. She gets a lover."

However, "discharge on the side" rarely ever leads to the normalization of relations with her husband, more often than not continuous cheating further alienates the spouses, and everything ends in divorce.

## How to prevent this situation?

The situation is very complicated and contradictory. But you have to understand that it's not the woman's fault either.

I would advise all men - not to lead to this situation and fight the first manifestations of sexual impotence and eliminate any problems in sex. For example, the same premature ejaculation, which often affects young men. Especially since medics are now well aware of the causes of these problems, and they have learned how to effectively deal with them.
