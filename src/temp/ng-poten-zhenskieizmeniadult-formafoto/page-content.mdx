# 97% of wives after 40 consider cheating to be justified if her husband has problems with potency or if he is unable to have quality sex

This was the conclusion of an anonymous survey of Nigerian women whose husbands had problems with potency, early ejaculation or small penis size. The conclusion is fully consistent with statements made earlier by sexologists - "sexual impotence in men and the inability to bring a woman to orgasm almost always pushes women to cheating and is the most frequent cause of divorce".

Although a woman has never cheated on a man or even thought about it, the lack of satisfaction from sex "turns everything inside her head" and makes cheating not only possible, but desirable. This happens at the level of physiological processes.

**Maryam Nwokocha**, a well-known sexologist, female physician, Ph.D.:

![Maryam Nwokocha has been studying the effect of cheating by women in the absence of consistent sex with their husbands for 5 years](files/images/content-1.webp)

> "Women's cheating is legitimate if there is no meaningful sex in the relationship or if the woman does not get what she needs out of it. Imagine yourself in the role of that woman. The need to have sex is created physiologically - the desire is always there, and you can't fight it off. A woman has to live with it all the time without getting the release.
>
> How does this affect a woman? Without discharge nerves are constantly tense - as a result, even a calm woman before becomes nervous and irritable. In a relationship there are scandals that can happen for no reason at all. The more the couple fights, the more the distance from each other, the relationship becomes more cold. As a result, even those women who used to be proud of their honesty towards her husband begin to cheat.
>
> Initially it happens accidentally - at work or with other people. After the first time a woman is tormented by thoughts of cheating, but she constantly recalls the feelings she got. She cannot get used to the idea that for the rest of her life she will not have sex anymore. So one day she cheats again. And then again and again. She gets a lover.
>
> However, "discharge on the side" rarely ever leads to the normalization of relations with her husband, more often than not continuous cheating further alienates the spouses, and everything ends in divorce."

**Q:** Maryam, who do you believe is to blame for this situation?

**A:** The situation is very complicated and contradictory. But you have to understand that it's not the woman's fault either.

I would advise all men - not to lead to this situation and fight the first manifestations of sexual impotence and eliminate any problems in sex. For example, the same premature ejaculation, which often affects young men. Especially since medics are now well aware of the causes of these problems, and they have learned how to effectively deal with them.

**Q:** Is it possible to increase potency and improve the quality of sex without serious interventions in your body?

We asked this question to Professor Joseph Hudu, an honored doctor of Nigeria, the head of the National Center of Urology.

!["I don't understand those men who, at the age of 50-60, bow their heads and decide that nothing can be done, and end their sex life. Why? When you can have fun all the way to old age!"](files/images/content-2.webp)

> Yes, you can. Now with the advent of modern preparations this is no longer a problem. For example, I recommend to my patients a very good product called **[PRODUCT_NAME]**. It helps 99.9% of men - even those who haven't had any potency for several years and who have other sexual problems.
>
> This product has two powerful effects. First, it gives a strong surge of testosterone, which dramatically increases arousal. In simple terms, **[PRODUCT_NAME]** makes a man a male who wants sex very much. Secondly, **[PRODUCT_NAME]** increases erection by more than 30 times in just 5 minutes after intake. The effect of **[PRODUCT_NAME]** lasts for over 8 hours, which makes it possible to have sex all night long.

**Q:** Is [PRODUCT_NAME] better than Viagra?

> It is more up-to-date. Viagra is a good product, but it is very outdated. Viagra was discovered 30 years ago. It has several significant disadvantages. First, the sildenafil in its composition acts only in the presence of arousal. That is, without arousal an erection will not appear, so VIAGRA DOES NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE!
>
> The second important disadvantage of Viagra is that it causes catastrophic harm to your body. Doctors compare one dose of Viagra to shortening your life by 2 days, which is quite significant. Viagra causes serious damage to the blood vessels, heart, liver, brain, nervous system and much more.
>
> **[PRODUCT_NAME]** is the most modern product and it is devoid of these disadvantages. It increases an erection and gives arousal to absolutely everyone. For example, if a man wants to sleep so much and he takes **[PRODUCT_NAME]**, as a result - he will fall asleep, but with a strong erection and most likely while he sleeps he will have erotic dreams because he will want sex.

<u>
  That means that [PRODUCT_NAME] is a product of absolute action. If you take it, an erection and
  the strongest arousal will be guaranteed!
</u>

In addition to increasing potency **[PRODUCT_NAME]** has a number of other remarkable actions (**[PRODUCT_NAME]** - a complex product for eliminating any problems in the sexual sphere in men).

The main actions of **[PRODUCT_NAME]** also include:

- Increase in penis size (+ 30% in volume)
- Increase in interest in women and sex in general
- Increase in the pleasure you get during sex
- Increase in testosterone production (3-4 times before sex, which increases passion)
- Improve the quality and quantity of semen
- Increase in the duration of intercourse (up to 3 hours with active movement)
- Increase in sensitivity of the penis and erogenous zones

Viagra is not recommended for elderly people, people with heart disease and hypertension. **[PRODUCT_NAME]** is safe for everyone.

Due to this wide range of effects **[PRODUCT_NAME]** can be used both by men who are dissatisfied with the duration of intercourse or the size of their penis, as well as by men who have serious difficulties in achieving a stable erection or have no potency at all.

**Q:** How important is it for a man to have a stable potency? What effect does it have on health?

> Sex is important for every man. During sex, the blood vessels are cleared and the prostate secretion is renewed. When there is no sex there is stagnation in the prostate that may lead to adenoma and prostate cancer (occurs in 68% of men at the age of 50-60 years, the most common reason for the disease is sexual impotence).
>
> Moreover, blood stagnates in the vessels, especially in the small capillaries that feed all internal organs. In blood vessels due to this appears blood clots, which is fraught with high blood pressure and hypertension, and if the clot breaks off, then a heart attack or stroke.
>
> Having sex is important for men - it's the basis of health and a long trouble-free life! No less important is that good sex provides harmony in the family. Sex is essential for strong family relationships, without sex everything falls apart at once.

**Q:** Where can I order [PRODUCT_NAME] to restore potency and eliminate sexual problems, and how much does it cost?

> You can order it at the minimum price by leaving a request in a special form. In Nigeria, the drug is distributed by the National Center for Male Health, a respected organization.

  > I am amazed at the effect of this product! It's really much better than Viagra. I haven't had such passionate sex and profuse ejaculation for a long time. I really liked it. I am sure that it would raise my spirits, I've never felt such power. I woke up in the morning without any side effects. After Viagra I was dying every time.

- **Isah Sagir** (date-6):

  > [PRODUCT_NAME] is the best product, I agree completely. I heard about it a year ago. Since then I have been using it only. I am 69 years old. My potency after [PRODUCT_NAME] is excellent. My wife and mistress are satisfied) I want to have sex after [PRODUCT_NAME] all the time. I feel like a man alive after [PRODUCT_NAME]! I recommend it to everyone.

- **Sani Ukoma** (date-6):

  > Thank you, I ordered! The price was pleasantly surprising. Viagra is worse and costs more!

- **Amina Nnamani** (date-5):

  > I have to order one for my husband!!! He hasn't had his potency for a long time, and the article correctly says that as soon as sex is gone from a woman's life, she starts looking at other men. I've noticed this about myself. Cheating is bad, but what can you do if your body demands it. I really hope that [PRODUCT_NAME] will help my husband!

- **Usman Chukwuemeka** (date-4):

  > I liked [PRODUCT_NAME]. My potency improved, sex came back into the relationship. My wife stopped nagging me about everything. Harmony in the family again. Almost went through a divorce. I recommend [PRODUCT_NAME] to everyone - it will save the marriage.

- **Muhammad Shamsu** (date-4):

  > [PRODUCT_NAME] became my secret. Because of it I began to enjoy success with girls. In comparison, without [PRODUCT_NAME] I had no sex at all. Now girls call me and offer to meet me when they want sex. I even have to say no.)

- **Abubakar Jubril** (date-3):

  > I have also had positive experiences with [PRODUCT_NAME]. I am 54 years old. Lately my potency was almost nonexistent. It appeared very rarely. I tried a lot of things to get it back. Traditional recipes, pills, went to a urologist many times. The only thing that helped was this drug. Now I have sex once a week on a regular basis. Plus my health has improved because testosterone is good for the male body.

- **Kabiru Bolaji** (date-3):

  > My potency is fine, no one has ever complained, but I decided to try [PRODUCT_NAME] for fun. It was the best sex I ever had. Like heaven and earth. Really within 5 minutes of taking it I wanted to have sex so badly as never before. I've never had such a strong orgasm before. And my penis really got bigger in volume, which increased the friction. All in all it was worth it! For those who have problems, it's definitely worth a try. And for everyone else too.

- **Hassan Jude** (date-3):

  > Ordered. Since we still have it. Delivery is fast. I've never ordered anything online, but it turned out to be easy.

- **Abdullahi Odey** (date-3):

  > The product is great. Without it, I can hold it for 3 minutes at the most if there are no breaks. With it, half an hour! And the erection is just like a stone.

- **Yusuf Bulama** (date-3):

  > I read the details about [PRODUCT_NAME]. Impressive! For retired men, it is an extremely useful product. It promotes the production of testosterone, which protects against old age, plus increases libido. That's what I'm having trouble with. I'm not interested in women anymore. I really hope that [PRODUCT_NAME] will make me interested again.

- **Idris Ekundayo** (date-3):

  > I also felt younger after taking [PRODUCT_NAME]. It was recommended to me by my doctor.

- **Ibrahim Amadu** (date-3):

  > I had impotence from nerves. Neither Cialis nor Viagra helped much. I decided to try [PRODUCT_NAME]. I had an erection for 5 hours, I came three times during this time. It's an extraordinary complex. Viagra was nothing compared to it. I will definitely order for myself again, especially at this price.

- **Ruth Bishir** (date-3):

  > My husband and I loved it. Very impressive sex! It's good for diversifying your sex life if you're tired of it.

- **Mohammed Ukachukwu** (date-3):

  > Thank you, I ordered it, as long as it's in stock. The operator said there is not much [PRODUCT_NAME] left, maybe not enough for everyone.

- **Ali Noah** (date-3):
  > I also left a request. Why not try it, if everyone praises it so much. My friend also told me about [PRODUCT_NAME].)
